# Neural Architecture Search for Time Series on Climate Data

Modeling a Recurrent Neural Network using Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to forecast climate/environmental time series.

## Notes

- NAS explores RNN variants (e.g., LSTM/GRU), units, layers, dropout, learning rate, and window sizes.
- Results and charts can be saved to outputs/ (create if needed).
